# gale-shapley-implementation

We implement the gale shapley algorithm to solve the stable matching problem. In this problem we consider a hospitals and residents. Hospitals provide a list of preferences for students and students provide a list of preferences for hospitals. The algorithm takes both these lists into considerations and provides a stable matching where both students and the hospitals get their best chioce possible. This implementation uses the gale shapley algorithm.
